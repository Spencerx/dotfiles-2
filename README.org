* Oh-my-*nix 
** Introduction
   Maybe you have to switch different OS fluently as I do, and you are exhausted
   about spending a whole day to configure *nix(Mac/Linux), even though you miss
   your crafted environment so much. I just try to make everything become easy,
   so we could focus on programming instead of tweak environment. 
   Note: All tool could be installed by [[file:install_awesome_tool.sh][script: install_awesome_tool.sh]]
** Linux Special
   Even though Linux and Mac both are derived from Unix, but there are something
   special for linux. 
*** i3wm
    [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]] is a nice tilling window manager, I think it change my though about X
    window system. With i3, I could control my Linux desktop without
    mouse. Mouseless -- efficient, productive, isn't it ? But something I thing
    it is unfriendly with i3, you have to configure i3wm from scratch. Some guys
    want a out-of-box window manager, so they dive into KDE, GNOME, XFCE,
    etc. However, if you have enough patience and aesthetic, you could own an
    gorgeous WM. You will be amazed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/][by them]].

    Screenshot of my i3 desktop:
*** plugin for i3
    i3 is just a plain window manager, so if you want a perfect WM, you may need some plugins:
**** i3lock
     [[https://i3wm.org/i3lock/][i3lock]] is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will
     see a white screen(you can configure the color/an image)
**** rofi
     [[https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/][Rofi]] is a window switcher, run dialog and dmenu(i3 default application
     launcher) replacement:

**** feh
     [[https://feh.finalrewind.org/][Feh]] is an X11 image viewer aimed mostly at console userd. Unlike most other
     viewers, it does not have a fancy GUI, but simply displays images. So I use
     it to display wallpaper.
**** compton
     [[https://github.com/chjj/compton][Compton]] is a standalone composite manager, suitable for use with window
     managers that do not natively provide compositing functionality (such as
     i3wm).
**** dunst
     [[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][Dunst]] is a lightweight and customizable notification daemon. I use it to
     send notification.
**** i3-sensible-terminal(xterm)
     [[http://build.i3wm.org/docs/i3-sensible-terminal.html][i3-sensible-terminal]] is invoked in the i3 default config to start a
     terminal. You could have several choices, such as /urext/, /termit/,
     /rxvt/, etc. I choose /xterm/
**** nm-applet
     NetworkManager is a program for providing detection and configuration for
     systems to automatically connect to network.
*** zeal
    [[https://zealdocs.org/][Zeal]] is an offline documentation browser for software developers inspired by
    Mac [[https://kapeli.com/dash][Dash]].

*** iotop
    [[http://guichaz.free.fr/iotop/][Iotop]] is top like utilty but for disk I/O rather than process. It could show
    you the real-time disk I/O situation.

** *nix Special
   These tools are all available in Mac/Linux.
*** emacs
    [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] -- a life style, awesome.
*** vim
    [[http://www.vim.org/][Vim]] is the most powerful editor in this planet(Emacs is not an editor).

*** htop
    [[http://hisham.hm/htop/][Htop]] is an iteractive process viewer for Unix systems which is simliar to
    /top/ command, but much better and has more features.

*** ag(the_silver_searcher)
    [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][Ag]] is a code-searching tool similar to grep, but much faster. In 2016, it was
    the fastest searching tool in terminal, now it is the second fastest search
    tool. And its advantage is that it is available in all *nix platforms, even
    though Windows(cygwin).

*** ripgrep
    [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][Ripgrep]] combines the usablity of The Silver Searcher with the raw speed of
    grep. It is the fastest code-search tool now, it faster than ag, ack, git
    grep, grep, and etc.

*** httpie
    [[https://httpie.org/][Httpie]] is a modern command line HTTP client --user-friendly curl alternative
    with intuitive UI, JSON support, syntax highlighting, wget-like downloads,
    extensions,etc.

*** tree
    [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree][Tree]] could list contents of directory in a tree-like format

    [[file:images/Oh-my-*nix/Tree-Display-Structure-Directory-Hierarchy-493x1024_2017-05-16_16-00-59.png]]
*** shellcheck
    [[https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck][Shellcheck]] is a static analysis tool for shell scirpts, it so so so useful to
    help you check your shellscript. It also could be integrate with Vim/Emacs,
    so sweet.
    Screenshot:

    [[file:images/Oh-my-*nix/2014-07-16-6m47421-shellcheck_2017-05-16_16-09-20.jpg]]
*** axel
    [[http://axel.alioth.debian.org/][Axel]] is a so powerful download accelerator, in my opinion, it is the fastest
    command line dowloader(but I have no benchmark). It is lightweight and
    support many procotols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS procotols. Axel is
    always my first choice to download something from Internet.
    Screenshot:
    [[./images/axel.png]] 
*** aria2c
    [[https://aria2.github.io/][Aria2]] is a lightweight multi-protocol & multi-source command=line download
    utility which is similiar to axel, but has more features and a little bit
    slower than axel (just a little bit, in my opinion). It supports HTTP,
    HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent and Metalink. Moreover arai2 can also be
    manipulated via built-in JSON-RPC and XML-RPC interface. Because I care
    download speed so much, so my first choice is axel, but some urls could not
    be downloaded by axel, I will switch to aria2.
    Screenshot:
    [[./images/aria2c.png]]
*** percol
    [[https://github.com/mooz/percol][Percol]] could add flavor of interactive filtering to the traditional pipe
    concept of Unix shell. If you are an Emacs user, you will find it so
    familiar, because percol is inspired by anything.el and Helm (the Emacs
    framework for incremental completions and narrowing selections) is fork from
    *anything.el*. I could die without percol

    [[file:images/Oh-my-*nix/percol_overview_2017-05-16_17-17-21.gif]]
*** yapf
    [[https://github.com/google/yapf][Yapf]] is a formatter for python files developed by Google. As for formatter,
    there are other choices ---e.g. autopep8,and pep8ify -- are made to remove
    lint errors from code. I think yapf is better, and I integrate it into Emacs. 
*** jq
    [[https://github.com/stedolan/jq][Jq]] is like /sed/ for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map
    and transform structured data with the same ease that /sed/, /awk/, /grep/
    and friends let you play with text.
    Screenshot:
    [[./images/jq.png]]
*** cloc
    [[http://cloc.sourceforge.net/][Cloc]] is similiar to /wc/ command, but is special to code instead of
    text. Cloc means *count lines of code*, which could count blank lines,
    comments lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming
    languages.
    Screenshot:
    [[./images/cloc.png]]
*** pandoc
    [[http://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] is a so powerful universal document converter. It could convert so
    many document formats to other format, including markdowm, HTML, DocBook,
    Latex, Org-mode and so on.
    This is the format list it could convert to :
    [[./images/diagram.jpg]]
*** guile
    [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][Guile]] is a scheme implementation, it is useful when I learn code from LICP
*** mosh
    [[https://mosh.org/][Mosh]] is a replacement for SSH, It is more robust and responsive, especially
    over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance. Although I am still using SSH, but
    when I am in a poor network, mosh is a better alternaive than SSH.
*** proxychains-ng
    [[https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng][Proxychains-ng]] is a powerful, new-generation preloader in terminal. It could
    hide your command like curl, wget behind socks/http proxies. If you are a
    programmre from China, you could find it so useful.
*** ncdu
    [[https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu][Ncdu]] is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface.It is designed to
    find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire graphical
    setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems.In
    my opinion, It is the best command line disk usage analyzer I ever used.
    Screenshot:
    [[./images/ncdu.png]]
*** tldr
    [[http://tldr-pages.github.io/][Tldr]] is a simplified and community-driven man pages. The document of command
    in Unix is awesome, but perhaps you find it too verbose to read (just like
    me). Then, tldr will save your life. Tldr means "too long, don't read", it
    could simply the man pages
